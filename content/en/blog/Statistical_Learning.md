# Statistical Learning
Recently is obsess with statistical learning (SL), and think that SL is literally applicable in everyday life event. Since I just think of some for now (most of them just skipped my head and it's truly amazing feeling!), I will list them here.

	* Perfect pitch practice in infants
	* Non-native speaker learning English (or any other foreign language) by representation instead of translational understanding
	* Everything related to **pattern separation**
	* ......

This is an immature thought, but SL could be an essential key to solve many specific cognition problems in the way of learning.
