Since being in [Charan's lab](http://dml.ucdavis.edu) in Davis, I started to get the true feeling of research. It is not about pure passion in "I'm doing something special", but more like "I'm doing what attracts me". To be honest, research could be hard and demanding, which probably means occupying tons of your time being stupid; nevertheless, I am still here and being satisfied. I haven't had any chance to publish anything, but it has already hypnotized me. Doing research, no matter which specific project, is just learning to me. I've always loved the feeling of being able to sense the ignorance of myself, no matter in what part of life. And staying in awe about everything is just one necessity of a great and smart learner.

Still, the story can extend, but I decide to be more practical and just post here ideas that I have thought (and written down of course) of. Some of them might be just naive, some might be extremely hard, but whatever. Here we go:


- How can we use psychological or neurofeedback methods to improve athletes' performance?

- Is there any essential difference in the brain when reading books & e-books (or Paper vs. Screen)?

- What happens when people feel __spatial presence__? And more interestingly, what happens when people pull themselves out of that presence?

- Is memory for music & movies chunked into sequential "events" or temporally drifting? (i.e., how does our brain organizes these kinds of memory?)
	- Interesting facts, I feel ok seeing movies backwards but not music...

- Is our representation of the world factorized or not? How exactly can human beings recombine so many things into never-seen episodes? Can AI do that? :)

- Does our pre-experience ability in sequence learning reflect some structures we learn or it's just some neural dynamics preconfigured? (check out this [amazing paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419306403))

- My BIGGEST curiosity: is everything explicable by __LAZINESS__ (behavioral + neural)?
