Since being here in Berkely, life has become busy and full. I can imagine after a day of classes and RA works, I'll just have no time and energy left for my private business, and that's definitely not "cool". Being a potential researcher in cognitive science is hard but full of surprises and the kind of feeling that I want. I'm not sure if it is general, but everytime I got that feeling, I would be just like "fast recharged" and happy to accept everything imperfect in the world. It's a sense of expection being fullfilled.

But that feeling barely appears, it always requires tons of efforts in what I'm interested in. Before that, I'm at "diving mode"--

Diving so deep that I can't even breathe, even though I never intend to.

Above is some nonsense to others, this is my very first blog and I want to make it simple. Leave some space for self, enjoy some other cool things. 

Life is like a milk, pure and cute.
