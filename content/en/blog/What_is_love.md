 - It is simply another type of serial dependence (Manassi, 2019).

 - It is when I stare at you and you stare at your stuffs.

 - It is when I listen to my favorite song and look at your smile.

 - It is when we finish our daily ritual and haste to hang up.

 - It is reciprocal support and understanding.
