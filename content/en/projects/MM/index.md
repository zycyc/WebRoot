How does human learn music? The one simple answer will be repeatedly listening, but what's the underlying neural mechanism that supports this learning process? Better memory performance is predicted by higher representational similarity between encoding and retrieval (Xue, 2010), is memory of music the same? Beyond this question, I also want to find out how cortex and hippocampus represent musical features like tempo, pitch, rhythm, and how these two representations interact to depict music learning curve.

We developed a paradigm for recognizing whether subjects completely learn a song. Using this paradigm in EEG and MEG, it's possible for us to answer questions related to predictive coding, fast replay, compressed representation in music.

Through this paradigm, we found significantly decreased response time of tonal variation, significantly increased accuracy rate, and significantly increased the completeness in the silent recall task as subjects learn. In the ERP analysis of EEG data, we found similarities and differences between this paradigm and the previous classical MMN paradigm. In specific, we found that at 156.25-244.14 ms following the changed note, the brain generates significant negative component (MMN). This finding converges with previous studies but in a different manner. The component, although violating the shape of classic MMN, suggests the similarity between musical sequence learning and traditional sequence learning using oddball paradigm, while also demonstrates the unique properties of music that shape the way our brains learn a natural sequence in daily life.
