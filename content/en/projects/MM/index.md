How does human learn music? The one simple answer will be repeatedly listening, but what's the underlying neural mechanism that supports this learning process? Better memory performance is predicted by higher representational similarity between encoding and retrieval (Xue, 2010), is memory of music the same? Beyond this question, I also want to find out how cortex and hippocampus represent musical features like tempo, pitch, rhythm, and how these two representation interact to depict music learning curve.

We developed a paradigm for recognizing whether subjects completely learn a song. Using this paradigm in EEG and MEG, it's possible for us to answer questions related to predictive coding, fast replay, compressed representation in music......
