title: "Serial Dependence"
weight: 3

We tend to perceive the world around us as stable in space and time, a study by Fischer and Whitney (2014) suggests that human visual perception is serially dependent, using both prior and present input to inform perception at the present moment. Specifically, perceived orientation in an orientation judgment task is likely biased towards previously seen stimuli.

Currently I'm doing replication and relevant experiment both on-line and off-line with Dr. Mauro Manassi and Prof. William Prinzmetal. We found that attention is a key moderator in serial dependence and I'm now using PsychoPy + Pavlovia to achieve some interesting online experiments.
