title: "Serial Dependence"

We tend to perceive the world around us as stable in space and time, a study by Fischer and Whitney (2014) suggests that human visual perception is serially dependent, using both prior and present input to inform perception at the present moment. Specifically, perceived orientation in an orientation judgment task is likely biased towards previously seen stimuli.

While I was an exchange student in UC Berkeley during Spring 2019 semester, I did replication and relevant experiments both on-line and off-line with Prof. Mauro Manassi and Prof. William Prinzmetal. We found that attention is a key moderator in serial dependence and I used PsychoPy + Pavlovia to achieve some interesting online experiments.
