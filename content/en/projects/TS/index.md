Using similar paradigm with [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753784) (Crivelli-Decker, Hsieh, Clarke & Ranganath, 2018), we are trying to use EEG to unravel the role of the mysterious theta/alpha oscillations in temporal sequence learning, and the difference between healthy people and schizophrenia patients.

Previous studies have found decreased oscillatory power in the theta (4-7Hz) band at frontal sites following decisions about objects in "consistent sequences", compared to "random" sequences; and also increased parieto-occipital alpha (10-13Hz) power before decisions. Our studies replicated the findings in healthy group, but for the patients group, there seems to be another pattern...
