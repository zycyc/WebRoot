My name is Yicong (Alan) Zheng, a passionate psych student who is obsessed with the study of memory. I started doing memory research in freshman year and is interested in a wide range of relevant topics. My interest changes from time to time (but mostly stays in memory), and I pretty open about other exciting stuff. I am currently interested in the way that people combine their past memory and make them into a mental representation of never-experienced prediction about future (`Episodic Future Thinking`, EFT) and its possible interaction with AI, who will either borrow this wisdom from people or become smarter and more advanced than us using algorithms we don't know yet (afterall, we are just [type 0.72 civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)). When not doing research, I enjoy `singing in karaoke`, `playing badminton` and `exploring all tech-related stuff`.


### Research Ideas & Questions

* Use Internet+ technique to help collecting (big) data (e.g., collecting huge training sets using mobile phone apps).
* What's the underlying neural mechanism by which human brain forms representation of songs?
* How does learning help us predict subsequent events (-- in what way)?
* Is everything in the world explicable by __LAZINESS__?
